# Project Report  
## Spam Email Detection with GUI (Python)

### 1. Introduction
Spam messages are a common issue in mobile communication.  
This project aims to classify messages as *Spam* or *Ham* using Python machine learning.

---

### 2. Objective
To build a GUI-based spam detection system using Naive Bayes and TF-IDF.

---

### 3. Dataset
Dataset used: SMS Spam Collection Dataset (Kaggle)

Contains:
- **label**: spam/ham
- **message**: text message

---

### 4. Methodology
1. Data preprocessing  
2. Label encoding  
3. Train-test split  
4. TF-IDF vectorization  
5. Train Naive Bayes model  
6. Build Tkinter GUI  
7. Real-time prediction  

---

### 5. Algorithms Used
- TF-IDF Vectorizer  
- Multinomial Naive Bayes  

---

### 6. Results
- Model Accuracy ~98%  
- Fast and lightweight  

---

### 7. GUI Features
- Text box input  
- Detect button  
- Spam/Ham display  

---

### 8. Conclusion
A simple and effective spam detection system that can be expanded to email-level spam filtering.

---

### 9. Future Enhancements
- Add email file detection  
- Deploy as web app  
- Use BERT-based NLP models
