📝 Project Statement – Movie Recommendation System

📌 Problem Statement

With thousands of movies released worldwide, users often struggle to decide what to watch. Manually searching for movies that match personal taste is time-consuming and inefficient. There is a need for an intelligent system that can automatically analyze movie data and recommend films based on user preferences.
